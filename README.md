#### Hello Noah


Git is used for controlling different versions of the same project. It doesn't care how you organize your files, it just makes sure everybody has the same copies of everything. So if you want to share code with people and be sure they always have the most up-to-date version, you can use Git!

Or if you want multiple people to work on the same project and see each other's updates, use git. Or if you want to control what modifications make it in to the project and what doesn't use Git! Check out how pull requests work.
